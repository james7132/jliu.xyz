title = "About Me"
+++

I'm James Liu, a software engineer. Currently living in the San Francisco Bay
Area.

I was born with [infantile nystagmus
syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus). This has heavily impacted
my visual acuity and focus. This has robbed me of my binocular depth perception
and any semblance of hand-eye coordination. I can't drive (legally), and don't
expect me be playing seriously in any ball sport.

From a young age, this disconnect with the physical world has made me
turn my pursuits inwards. I've always loved the sciences, and held the great
engineers and mathematicians of our time in high esteem. Our world, cold and
indifferent to our existence as it may be, holds unfathomable complexity and
beauty.
